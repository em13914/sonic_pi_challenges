Functions are great for when the pattern of notes (sleeps) and the actual notes are exactly the same.

Parameterized functions are great for when:
a. the pattern of notes is the same but the actual notes are different!
b. two chunks of code are almost identical but have a few slight differences!

YOUR TASK: Use a parameterised function to optimize the code below.
